> Building borderless capabilities through language, expression, and domain thinking.

## What is this repository?

This repository is a **long-term personal capability system**, not a project codebase
and not an exam-preparation repo.

It exists to help me:

- Use English as a **working and thinking language**
- Build reusable **expression and explanation abilities**
- Explore multiple domains (e.g. Quant, Web3) without being locked into one path
- Prepare for international collaboration, remote work, and future opportunities

English here is **a tool**, not the goal.

> Its purpose is **capability accumulation**, not content accumulation.

## Core philosophy

- Language is an execution engine, not a subject
- Domains are thinking spaces, not commitments
- Output matters more than input
- Reusability matters more than completeness
- The system should reduce cognitive load（认知负担）, not increase it

If maintaining structure ever feels heavier than learning itself,
the structure should be simplified.

## Repository structure

```markdown
esti-borderless-skills/
├── 0-inbox/ # Temporary holding area (no rules, no structure)

## How learning flows through this system

- `inbox` collects without thinking
- `works` is where thinking and drafting happen
- `library` stores only mature, reusable assets
- `log` records continuity and irreversible growth

## About IELTS materials

IELTS materials are used **purely as training data**:

- To practice structured speaking
- To reduce cognitive load in expression
- To improve fluency and clarity

This repository does **not** optimize for test scores.
It optimizes for real communication ability.

## Long-term vision

This repository supports:

- Borderless learning
- Cross-domain thinking
- International communication
- Reduced dependency on a single local job market

It is an investment in **optionality**, not short-term outcomes.
