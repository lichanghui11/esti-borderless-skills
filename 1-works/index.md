# Works

This folder contains all **in-progress drafts and training materials**.

Everything here is unfinished.

---

## What belongs here

- Drafts of language expressions
- Domain-related explanation attempts
- Training outputs based on IELTS or other materials
- Messy, partial, or exploratory writing

This is the **process zone**, not the asset zone.

---

## Folder roles

- `lan-drafts/`  
  Language-focused expression practice  
  (fluency, structure, speaking patterns)

- `domain-drafts/`  
  Domain-related expression drafts  
  (explaining concepts from Quant, Web3, tech, etc.)

Subfolders may change over time.
That is expected.

---

## Rules

- Draft quality is expected to be imperfect
- Files may be rewritten or deleted freely
- Nothing here is considered reusable by default
- **Anything promoted to `2-library/` must first live here**

If you are unsure whether something is “good enough”,
it belongs here, not in the library.
