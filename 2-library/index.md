# Library

This folder contains **polished, reusable capability assets**.

It represents what I can confidently use in real communication.

---

## Entry criteria (all must be true)

An item can enter the library only if:

- I can explain it clearly **without notes**
- I have used it more than once
- I feel confident using it in real conversations
- It reduces cognitive load when speaking or explaining

If any of these are not true, it belongs in `1-works/`.

---

## What does NOT belong here

- Drafts or partial thoughts
- Listening practice materials
- Raw notes or copied text
- Unverified understanding
- Anything kept “just in case”

The library is not an archive.
It is an **active capability set**.

## Subfolders explained

### `speaking-assets/`

Ready-to-use spoken content.

Examples:

- Structured monologues
- Clear answers to common questions
- Explanations I can deliver smoothly

These are expressions I can **say**, not just write.

---

### `explanation-assets/`

Concepts I can clearly explain in English.

Examples:

- Quant or Web3 concepts explained in my own words
- Technical ideas I can teach to a non-expert
- Domain reasoning expressed clearly and simply

These represent **domain-expression ability**, not domain study.

---

## Library mindset

This folder should remain:

- Small
- Clean
- Trustworthy

If the library starts to feel cluttered,
it means the entry bar is too low.
