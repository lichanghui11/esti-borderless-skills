---

##  1. Who ?
I’d like to talk about my best friend, Amy. We’ve been best friends for over seven years now.

Amy is a tall girl with long hair and a slim figure. 

She is a very kind, reliable and sociable person who is good at expressing herself, which is why I always enjoy spending time with her.

## 2. How you met ?
We first met about seven or eight years ago at university, where we were in the same major. 

At that time, I was queuing up to register some documents, and we started chatting.

During university, we often went shopping, tried different kinds of tasty food, and even went hiking together on weekends.
> in the same major 是固定搭配吗？

不是严格固定搭配，但**非常常用、自然**。更地道替换：

- We were **in the same major**.（简单自然）
- We **majored in the same subject**.（更地道加分）


## 3. A specific example (What is her like?)
A perfect example of her kindness happened in our first year at university. 

When I was a freshman, we had a challenging project in the lab, and I was really struggling with the experiment. 

Amy was much better at it and noticed that I was worried. 

Instead of finishing her own part early, she spent a whole afternoon in the lab patiently guiding me through each step.

Thanks to her help, we managed to complete the project successfully and got a good grade. 

That experience impressed me a lot.
> queue up（英式：排队）
- **queue up to do sth**：排队去做某事
- **queue up for sth**：排队等某物  
  例：I was **queuing up to** register some documents.  
  = 我正在排队办理注册资料。
> managed to do（强调“好不容易最终做到”）
- **manage to do sth** = 最终成功做到（过程不容易）  
  例：We **managed to** complete the project.  
  = 我们最终还是把项目完成了（挺难的）。

## 4. 现状
Even after graduation, we’ve still kept in close touch. 

We chat online quite often, having long conversations about work, life and future plans.

We are already making travel plans for next year, although we haven’t decided on the destination yet. 

But we both feel excited about the idea.
> keep/stay in close touch（保持密切联系）
- **keep in touch**：保持联系
- **stay in close touch**：保持密切联系（更常用、更自然）  
  例：We’ve **stayed in close touch** after graduation.  
  = 毕业后我们也一直保持密切联系。

## 5. Conclusion
Overall, having a friend like Amy—someone who has shared so many memories with me and continues to be part of my life—is something I truly cherish.
