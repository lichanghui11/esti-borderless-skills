---

## 1. Opening and Where?
I’d like to talk about a time when I found out something really interesting through social media while watching short videos.

It happened a few months ago when I was at home in the evening, just relaxing and scrolling through short videos on my phone.
> found out：不只是“发现”，更像“后来才得知/查证到”

> **found out = get information that you didn’t know before**

> scrolling through：强调“手指滑动刷内容”的动作感
*  scroll through 不是“看”，而是“**快速上下滑、随手刷**”。在短视频/信息流语境特别贴切。
*  scroll through **my phone / my feed / short videos**
*  scroll through **Instagram/TikTok**
- **browsing** social media（更泛）
- **watching** short videos（更直白）
## 2. What you found out?
I came across a video of a young woman performing her original song, and she looked really familiar. 

At first, I thought she just resembled one of my university classmates, but after watching a few more clips, I realized it was actually her.

> **come across a video**：强调“无意间刷到/偶然遇到”
- come across = meet/find something **by chance**
- I **came across** a video…（偶然刷到）
- I **searched for** a video…（主动搜索）
- I **found** a video…（中性，可能主动也可能偶然）

> **looked familiar / resembled**：看起来眼熟 / 长得像

> resemble = look like (in appearance), 语气比 look like 更正式一点，常用于“外貌/风格像”。
- A resembles B ✅
- A resembles **someone** ✅
- ❌ resemble **to**（不要加 to）

> **original song**：原创歌曲

## 3. What you know about her?（才华 + 校内获奖 + 网路获奖 + 粉丝）
She was one of the most talented girls in my university. 

Back then, she could write lyrics and compose music all by herself. 

She used to win prizes almost every year at our school’s annual events, and later she even received awards online. 

She already had quite a lot of followers before, and now her fan base has grown even bigger.

What impressed me most was that her songs were quite different from most popular music. 

Instead of always focusing on love stories, she wrote about personal growth, dreams, and real-life feelings, which I found meaningful and refreshing.
> **fan base has grown**：粉丝群体扩大了
- a **loyal** fan base（忠实粉丝群）
- a **growing** fan base（不断增长的粉丝群）
- her fan base **has grown** rapidly（粉丝群增长很快）

> **Instead of …, she …**：不是……而是……（对比加分）

> **meaningful and refreshing**：有意义而且让人耳目一新

> **compose music**：偏正式，指“作曲”。 
- She could **write and produce her own songs**.（更现代、更贴音乐圈）
- She could **write lyrics and make her own music**.（更口语）
> **used to + 动词原形** = 过去经常/过去一直（**现在不一定还这样**）。  它强调“过去的习惯/常态”。

> **be used to + 名词/动名词** = 习惯于（完全不同！）
- I’m used to studying at night.（我习惯晚上学习）

## 4. What you did as a result?
After that, I followed her account immediately and listened to more of her songs. 

I also searched her name to see her work on other platforms. 

Later, I even sent her a message to say I was proud of her and her music really inspired me.
## 5. Why this information is so interesting?
This experience reminded me that social media can be more than entertainment. 

It can also help you reconnect with people and discover inspiring stories.

Seeing her success also motivated me to take my own hobbies more seriously.

> **motivated me to…**：激励我去……

## Conclusion
Overall, it was interesting because I didn’t expect to see someone I knew become so successful and creative, and her work felt truly original.
