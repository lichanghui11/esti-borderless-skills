Candlestick charts are widely used in technical analysis because they summarize price action in a compact visual form. Each candle represents a specific time frame—such as a day, a week, or a month—and contains the open, high, low, and close. The real body highlights the net change from open to close, while the upper and lower wicks (also called shadows or tails) reflect intraperiod volatility and price rejection.

A bullish candle usually closes above its open, suggesting stronger buying pressure during that period. A bearish candle closes below its open, indicating stronger selling pressure. By studying sequences of candles, investors and traders look for patterns that may hint at trend continuation, consolidation, or potential reversals. However, candlestick patterns should not be treated as automatic predictions. Their reliability depends on market conditions and context, and price can be heavily influenced by fundamental news or major events.

In practice, candlesticks work best as one tool within a broader framework: define the trend, identify key support and resistance levels, look for confirmation (for example, from volume or indicators), and always manage risk with clear entry rules and exit plans.
