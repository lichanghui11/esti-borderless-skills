History of Candlestick Charts
The Japanese began using technical analysis to trade rice in the 17th century. While this early version of technical analysis was different from the US version initiated by Charles Dow around 1900, many of the guiding principles were very similar:
日本人在 17 世纪就开始使用技术分析交易大米。虽然那时的技术分析和美国在 1900 年左右由 Charles Dow 推动的体系不一样，但很多指导原则其实非常相似。

固定短语

   All known information is reflected in the price.
2. 所有已知信息都会反映在价格里。
   Buyers and sellers move markets based on expectations and emotions (fear and greed).
3. 买卖双方会基于预期和情绪（恐惧与贪婪）推动市场。

￼
According to Steve Nison, candlestick charting first appeared sometime after 1850. Much of the credit for candlestick development and charting goes to a legendary rice trader named Homma from the town of Sakata. It is likely that his original ideas were modified and refined over many years of trading, eventually resulting in the system of candlestick charting that we use today.

根据 Steve Nison 的说法，蜡烛图大约在 1850 年之后出现。蜡烛图的发展很大一部分归功于一位来自酒田（Sakata）的传奇米商 Homma。很可能他的想法在多年交易中不断被修改与完善，最终形成了今天我们使用的蜡烛图体系。 ￼

Formation of Candlestick Charts 形成方式
To create a candlestick chart, you must have a data set that contains open, high, low and close values for each time period you want to display. The hollow or filled portion of the candlestick is called “the body” (also referred to as “the real body”). The long thin lines above and below the body represent the high/low range and are called “shadows” (also referred to as “wicks” and “tails”). The high is marked by the top of the upper shadow and the low by the bottom of the lower shadow.
要画蜡烛图，你需要每个时间周期的数据：开盘价、最高价、最低价、收盘价。蜡烛中间空心或实心的部分叫 body（实体/真实实体）。实体上下方的细线表示最高/最低的范围，叫 shadows（影线），也可称 wicks（烛芯） 或 tails（尾巴）。上影线的顶端就是最高价，下影线的底端就是最低价。 ￼

The high is marked by the top of the upper shadow and the low by the bottom of the lower shadow.
= 最高价由上影线的顶端标出来；最低价由下影线的底端标出来。
• The high：最高价（High）
• is marked by：被……标示/标记出来（在图上用某个位置表示）
• the top of the upper shadow：上影线的顶端
• and the low：以及最低价（Low）
• by the bottom of the lower shadow：由下影线的底端（标出来）
固定短语
• to create…, you must have…：要做……你必须有……
• a data set that contains…：包含……的数据集
• be called… / be referred to as…：被称为……
• represent…：代表/表示……
• be marked by…：通过……标记/体现（top/bottom marked by）
• hollow：空心的
• filled：实心的
• portion：部分
• refer to A as B：把 A 称为 B
• be referred to as：被称为……

术语解释（必须掌握）
• time period / time frame：时间周期（1 分钟/1 小时/1 天…）
• open / high / low / close (OHLC)：开/高/低/收
• body / real body：实体（开盘与收盘之间的“净变化”）
• shadow / wick / tail：影线/烛芯/尾巴（这一周期里曾到达的最高或最低）
wicks = shadows = tails（基本同义）
中文常叫：影线 / 上下影线。
• upper wick：上影线（实体上面那根细线）
• lower wick：下影线（实体下面那根细线）

If the stock closes higher than its opening price, a hollow candlestick is drawn with the bottom of the body representing the opening price and the top of the body representing the closing price. If the stock closes lower than its opening price, a filled candlestick is drawn with the top of the body representing the opening price and the bottom of the body representing the closing price.

如果收盘价高于开盘价，就画空心蜡烛：实体底部表示开盘价，顶部表示收盘价。
如果收盘价低于开盘价，就画实心蜡烛：实体顶部表示开盘价，底部表示收盘价。 ￼

close + adj
以……收盘 / 收盘时处于……状态
•closes higher than its opening price
= 收盘价高于开盘价
👉 representing = 表示 / 代表（不是“正在代表”，而是功能说明）
固定短语
• If …, … is drawn：如果……，就画……
• with A representing B：A 用来表示 B（representing 很常用）
“higher than its opening price” 是一个表语补足结构（主语补足语），准确说是：形容词比较结构，作 closes 的补足说明

术语
• hollow：空心（传统教材里常见“上涨=空心”）
• filled：实心（传统教材里常见“下跌=实心”）
你现在看到很多软件用“绿/红”，但原理与这里一致：关键永远是 close vs open。

Compared to traditional bar charts, many traders consider candlestick charts more visually appealing and easier to interpret. Each candlestick provides a simple, visually appealing picture of price action; a trader can instantly compare the relationship between the open and close and the high and low.

和传统柱状图相比，很多交易者觉得蜡烛图更直观、更容易解读。每根蜡烛都提供一幅简洁的“价格行为图片”，交易者能立刻对比开收关系和高低点。 ￼

固定短语
• Compared to…, … consider …：与……相比，很多人认为……
• more visually appealing：更“视觉友好/看着舒服”
• easier to interpret：更容易解读（interpret=解释/解读）
• instantly compare…：立刻比较……
• appeal（动词/名词）
• v. 吸引；呼吁；上诉
• n. 吸引力；呼吁；上诉
• appeal + -ing → appealing（形容词）
• appealing = attractive / interesting
• 表示“让人觉得有吸引力的、讨人喜欢的、引起兴趣的”

所以 appealing 在这里是 形容词（adjective）。

术语
• bar chart：柱状图（也能显示 OHLC，但视觉表达不同）
• interpret：在金融语境里常指“读图、解读信号”

The relationship between the open and close is considered vital information and forms the essence of candlesticks. Hollow candlesticks, where the close is greater than the open, indicate buying pressure. Filled candlesticks, where the close is less than the open, indicate selling pressure.

开盘价与收盘价之间的关系非常关键，是蜡烛图的“本质”。空心蜡烛（收>开）代表买盘压力；实心蜡烛（收<开）代表卖盘压力。 ￼

固定短语
• be considered vital information：被认为是关键信息（vital=非常关键）
• form the essence of…：构成……的核心/本质（非常加分表达）
• indicate…：表明/暗示……
• be considered + (to be) + 名词/形容词
• is considered vital information（被认为是关键信息）
• is considered important（被认为很重要）
• form + 名词：构成/形成（某物的组成部分）
• form the basis / core / foundation / essence of …
• form the basis of…（构成基础）
• form the core of…（构成核心）
• form the essence of…（构成本质）
• A indicates B：A 表明/显示/暗示 B
indicate 是更谨慎的词，意思是：➡️ “提供信号/迹象/提示”，不是百分百确定。

这里 form = make up / constitute（组成、构成）。

术语
• essence：本质（学术/专业表达常用）
• buying pressure / selling pressure：买方/卖方占优（你可以理解为“多空力量对比”）

Long Versus Short Bodies
Generally speaking, the longer the body is, the more intense the buying or selling pressure. Conversely, short candlesticks indicate little price movement and represent consolidation.

Long white candlesticks show strong buying pressure. The longer the white candlestick is, the further the close is above the open. This indicates that prices advanced significantly from open to close and buyers were aggressive. While long white candlesticks are generally bullish, much depends on their position within the broader technical picture. After extended declines, long white candlesticks can mark a potential turning point or support level. If buying gets too aggressive after a long advance, it can lead to excessive bullishness.

Long black candlesticks show strong selling pressure. The longer the black candlestick is, the further the close is below the open. This indicates prices declined significantly from the open and sellers were aggressive. After a long advance, a long black candlestick can foreshadow a turning point or mark a future resistance level. After a long decline, a long black candlestick can indicate panic or capitulation.

Even more potent long candlesticks are the Marubozu brothers, black and white. Marubozu bars don't have upper or lower shadows and the high and low are represented by the open or close (see image below).

White and black Marubozu candlesticks.
A white Marubozu forms when the open equals the low and the close equals the high. This indicates that buyers controlled the price action from the first trade to the last trade. Black Marubozu form when the open equals the high and the close equals the low. This indicates that sellers controlled the price action from the first trade to the last trade.

Long Versus Short Shadows
The upper and lower shadows on candlesticks can provide valuable information about the trading session. Upper shadows represent the session high and lower shadows the session low. Candlesticks with short shadows indicate that most of the trading action was confined near the open and close. Candlesticks with long shadows show that prices extended well past the open and close.

Candlesticks with a long upper shadow and short lower shadow indicate that buyers dominated during the session, bidding prices higher, but sellers ultimately forced prices down from their highs. This contrast of strong high and weak close resulted in a long upper shadow. Conversely, candlesticks with long lower shadows and short upper shadows indicate that sellers dominated during the session and drove prices lower. However, buyers later resurfaced to bid prices higher by the end of the session; the strong close created a long lower shadow.

Example of long upper and lower shadows in candlestick charts.
Long upper and lower shadows in candlestick bars.
Candlesticks with a long upper shadow, long lower shadow, and small real body are called spinning tops (see image below). One long shadow represents a reversal of sorts.

Illustration of the spinning tops candlestick pattern which has a long upper shadow, long lower shadow, and a small real body.
Spinning Tops candlestick pattern.
Spinning tops represent indecision. The small real body (whether hollow or filled) shows little movement from open to close, and the shadows indicate that bulls and bears were active during the session.

Even though the session opened and closed with little change, prices moved significantly higher and lower in the meantime. Neither buyers nor sellers could gain the upper hand and the result was a standoff.

After a long advance or long white candlestick, a spinning top indicates weakness among the bulls and a potential change or interruption in trend. After a long decline or long black candlestick, a spinning top indicates weakness among the bears and a potential change or interruption in trend.

Doji
Doji represent an important type of candlestick, providing information on their own and as components of many important patterns. Doji form when a security's open and close are virtually equal. The length of the upper and lower shadows can vary, with the resulting candlestick looking like a cross, inverted cross, or plus sign. Alone, doji are neutral patterns. Any bullish or bearish bias is based on preceding price action and future confirmation. The word “doji” refers to both the singular and plural form.

Illustration displaying three doji candlesticks.
Examples of Doji candlesticks.
Ideally, but not necessarily, the open and close should be equal. While a doji with an equal open and close would be considered more robust, it is more important to capture the essence of the candlestick. Doji convey a sense of indecision or tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. Prices move above and below the opening level during the session, but close at or near the opening level. The result is a standoff. Neither bulls nor bears were able to gain control and a turning point could be developing.

Different securities have different criteria for determining the robustness of a doji. A $20 stock could form a doji with a 0.125 point difference between open and close, while a $200 stock might form one with a 1.25 point difference. Determining the robustness of the doji will depend on the price, recent volatility, and previous candlesticks.

Relative to previous candlesticks, the doji should have a very small body that appears as a thin line (see image below).

Illustration of doji candlesticks with thin lines.
Example of a Doji candlestick with a thin line.
Steven Nison notes that a doji that forms among other candlesticks with small real bodies would not be considered important. However, a doji that forms among candlesticks with long real bodies would be deemed significant.

Doji and Trend
The relevance of a doji depends on the preceding trend or preceding candlesticks. After an advance, or long white candlestick, a doji signals that the buying pressure is starting to weaken. After a decline, or long black candlestick, a doji signals that selling pressure is starting to diminish.

Doji indicate that the forces of supply and demand are becoming more evenly matched and a change in trend may be near. On their own, doji are not enough to mark a reversal. You'll need further confirmation.

After an advance or long white candlestick, a doji signals that buying pressure may be diminishing and the uptrend could be nearing an end. To sustain an uptrend, there needs to be continued buying pressure. A security can decline in price if there aren't enough buyers. Therefore, a doji may be more significant after an uptrend or long white candlestick (see image below).

Example of doji after a long white candlestick.
A long white candle plus a doji can be significant after a long white candlestick.
Even after the doji forms, further downside is required for bearish confirmation. This may come as a gap down, long black candlestick, or decline below the long white candlestick's open. After a long white candlestick and doji, traders should be alert for a potential evening doji star.

An illustration of a long black candle plus a doji candlestick.
A long black candlestick plus a doji candlestick.
After a decline or long black candlestick, a doji indicates that selling pressure may be diminishing and the downtrend could be nearing an end. Even though the bears are starting to lose control of the decline, further strength is required to confirm any reversal. Bullish confirmation could come from a gap up, long white candlestick, or advance above the long black candlestick's open. After a long black candlestick and doji, traders should be on the alert for a potential morning doji star.

Long-Legged Doji
Long-legged doji have long upper and lower shadows almost equal in length. They reflect the market's indecision.

Illustration of three types of long-legged dojis.
Example of a long-legged doji.
Long-legged doji indicate that prices traded well above and below the session's opening level but closed virtually even with the open. After a whole lot of yelling and screaming, the result showed little change from the initial open.

Dragonfly and Gravestone Doji
Illustrations of dragonfly doji and gravestone doji.
Example of a dragonfly doji and gravestone doji.
Dragonfly Doji
Dragonfly doji form when the open, high, and close are equal, and the low creates a long lower shadow. The resulting candlestick looks like a “T” due to the lack of an upper shadow. Dragonfly doji indicate that sellers dominated trading and drove prices lower during the session. By the end of the session, buyers resurfaced and pushed prices back to the opening level and the session high.

The reversal implications of a dragonfly doji depend on previous price action and future confirmation. The long lower shadow provides evidence of buying pressure, but the low indicates that plenty of sellers still loom. After a long downtrend, long black candlestick, or at support, a dragonfly doji could signal a potential bullish reversal or bottom. After a long uptrend, long white candlestick, or at resistance, the long lower shadow could foreshadow a potential bearish reversal or top. Bearish or bullish confirmation is required for both situations.

Gravestone Doji
Gravestone doji form when the open, low, and close are equal, and the high creates a long upper shadow. The resulting candlestick looks like an upside-down “T” due to the lack of a lower shadow. Gravestone doji indicate buyers dominated trading and drove prices higher during the session. However, by the end of the session, sellers resurfaced and pushed prices back to the opening level, and the session low.

As with the dragonfly doji and other candlesticks, the reversal implications of gravestone doji depend on previous price action and future confirmation. Even though the long upper shadow indicates a failed rally, the intraday high provides evidence of some buying pressure. After a long downtrend, long black candlestick, or at support, the focus turns to the evidence of buying pressure and a potential bullish reversal. After a long uptrend, long white candlestick, or at resistance, the focus turns to the failed rally and a potential bearish reversal. Bearish or bullish confirmation is required for both situations.

Bulls Versus Bears
A candlestick depicts the battle between bulls (buyers) and bears (sellers) over a given period. An analogy to this battle can be made between two football teams, which we can also call the Bulls and the Bears. The candlestick's bottom (intra-session low) represents a touchdown for the Bears, and the top (intra-session high) a touchdown for the Bulls. The closer the close is to the high, the closer the Bulls are to a touchdown. The closer the close is to the low, the closer the Bears are to a touchdown. While there are many variations, let's narrow the field to six types of games (or candlesticks).

Illustration showing six types of bull vs. bears candlestick formations
The six types of Bull vs. Bears candlesticks.
Long white candlesticks indicate that the Bulls controlled the ball (trading) for most of the game.

Long black candlesticks indicate that the Bears controlled the ball (trading) for most of the game.

Small candlesticks indicate that neither team could move the ball, and prices finished about where they started.

A long lower shadow indicates that the Bears controlled the ball for part of the game but lost control by the end, and the Bulls made an impressive comeback.

A long upper shadow indicates that the Bulls controlled the ball for part of the game but lost control by the end, and the Bears made an impressive comeback.

A long upper and lower shadow indicates that both the Bears and the Bulls had their moments during the game, but neither could put the other away, resulting in a standoff.

What Candlesticks Don't Tell You
Candlesticks don't reflect the sequence of events between the open and close. They only reflect the relationship between the open and close. The high and the low are obvious and indisputable, but candlesticks (and bar charts) cannot tell us which came first.

With a long white candlestick, the assumption is that prices advanced most of the session. However, based on the high/low sequence, the session could have been more volatile. The example above depicts two possible high/low sequences forming the same candlestick.

An illustration of two high low sequences of candlestick bars.
Example of two possible High Low sequences.
The first sequence shows two small moves and one large move—a small decline off the open to form the low, a sharp advance to form the high, and a small decline to form the close. The second sequence shows three sharp moves—a sharp advance off the open to form the high, a sharp decline to form the low, and a sharp advance to form the close.

The first sequence portrays strong, sustained buying pressure and would be considered more bullish. The second sequence reflects more volatility and some selling pressure. These are just two examples; there are hundreds of potential combinations that could result in the same candlestick.

Candlesticks still offer valuable information on the relative positions of the open, high, low, and close. However, the trading activity that forms a particular candlestick can vary.

Prior Trend
In his book Candlestick Charting Explained, Greg Morris notes that, for a pattern to qualify as a reversal pattern, there should be a prior trend to reverse. Bullish reversals require a preceding downtrend, and bearish reversals require a prior uptrend. The direction of the trend can be determined using trend lines, moving averages, peak/trough analysis, or other aspects of technical analysis. A downtrend might exist if the security was trading below its downtrend line, below its previous reaction high, or below a specific moving average. The length and duration will depend on individual preferences. However, because candlesticks are short-term, it is usually best to consider the last 1-4 weeks of price action.

Candlestick Positioning
Star Position
A candlestick that gaps away from the previous candlestick is said to be in star position. The first candlestick usually has a large real body, but not always, and the second candlestick in the star position has a small real body.

An illustration of a star position candlestick that gaps away from the previous candlestick.
A Star Position gaps away from the previous candlestick.
Depending on the previous candlestick, the star position candlestick gaps up or down and appears isolated from the previous price action. The two candlesticks can be any combination of white and black. Doji, hammers, shooting stars, and spinning tops have small, real bodies and can form in the star position. There are also several two- and three-candlestick patterns that utilize the star position.

Harami Position
A candlestick that forms within the real body of the previous candlestick is in Harami position. Harami means pregnant in Japanese; appropriately, the second candlestick is nestled inside the first.

Illustration of a harami position where the candlestick forms within the real body of the previous candlestick
Harami position is a candlestick that forms within the real body of the previous candlestick.
The first candlestick usually has a large real body, and the second a smaller real body than the first. The second candlestick's shadows (high/low) do not have to be contained within the first, though it is preferable if they are. Doji and spinning tops have small real bodies, meaning they can form in the harami position as well. There are also several two- and three-candlestick patterns that utilize the harami position.

Long Shadow Reversals
There are two pairs of single candlestick reversal patterns: a small real body, one long shadow, and one short or non-existent shadow. Generally, the long shadow should be at least twice the length of the real body, which can be black or white. The location of the long shadow and preceding price action determine the classification.

The first pair, Hammer and Hanging Man, consists of identical candlesticks with small bodies and long lower shadows. The second pair, Shooting Star and Inverted Hammer, also contains identical candlesticks but with small bodies and long upper shadows. Only preceding price action and further confirmation determine the bullish or bearish nature of these candlesticks. The Hammer and Inverted Hammer form after a decline and are bullish reversal patterns, while the Shooting Star and Hanging Man form after an advance and are bearish reversal patterns.

Hammer and Hanging Man
The Hammer and Hanging Man look identical but have different implications based on the preceding price action. Both have small real bodies (black or white), long lower shadows, and short or non-existent upper shadows. As with most single and double candlestick formations, the Hammer and Hanging Man require confirmation before action.

Illustration of hammer and hanging man candlesticks.
Hammer and Hanging Man candlesticks.
The Hammer is a bullish reversal pattern that forms after a decline. In addition to a potential trend reversal, hammers can mark bottoms or support levels. After a decline, hammers signal a bullish revival. The low of the long lower shadow implies that sellers drove prices lower during the session. However, the strong finish indicates that buyers regained their footing to end the session on a strong note. While this may seem like enough to act on, hammers require further bullish confirmation. The low of the hammer shows that plenty of sellers remain. Further buying pressure, and preferably on expanding volume, is needed before acting. Such confirmation could come from a gap up or long white candlestick. Hammers are similar to selling climaxes, and heavy volume can serve to reinforce the validity of the reversal.

The Hanging Man is a bearish reversal pattern that can also mark a top or resistance level. Forming after an advance, a Hanging Man signals that selling pressure is starting to increase. The low of the long lower shadow confirms that sellers pushed prices lower during the session. Even though the bulls regained their footing and drove prices higher by the finish, the appearance of selling pressure raised the yellow flag. As with the Hammer, a Hanging Man requires bearish confirmation before action. Such confirmation can be a gap down or a long black candlestick on heavy volume.

Inverted Hammer and Shooting Star
The Inverted Hammer and Shooting Star look identical but have different implications based on previous price action. Both candlesticks have small real bodies (black or white), long upper shadows and small or nonexistent lower shadows. These candlesticks mark potential trend reversals but require confirmation before action.

Illustration of an inverted hammer and shooting star candlestick bars.
Inverted Hammer and Shooting Star.
The Shooting Star is a bearish reversal pattern that forms after an advance and in the star position, hence its name. A Shooting Star can mark a potential trend reversal or resistance level. The candlestick forms when prices gap higher on the open, advance during the session, and close well off their highs. The resulting candlestick has a long upper shadow and small black or white body. After a large advance (the upper shadow), the ability of the bears to force prices down raises the yellow flag. To indicate a substantial reversal, the upper shadow should be relatively long and at least 2 times the length of the body. Bearish confirmation is required after the Shooting Star and can be a gap down or a long black candlestick on heavy volume.

Illustration of an inverted hammer and shooting start candlestick pattern.
Inverted Hammer and Shooting Star candlestick reversal patterns.
The Inverted Hammer looks exactly like a Shooting Star, but forms after a decline or downtrend. Inverted Hammers represent a potential trend reversal or support levels. After a decline, the long upper shadow indicates buying pressure during the session. However, the bulls were not able to sustain this buying pressure and prices closed well off of their highs to create the long upper shadow. Because of this failure, bullish confirmation is required before action. An Inverted Hammer followed by a gap up or long white candlestick with heavy volume could act as bullish confirmation.

Blending Candlesticks
Candlestick patterns are made up of one or more candlesticks and can be blended to form one candlestick. This blended candlestick captures the essence of the pattern and can be formed using the following:

The open of the first candlestick

The close of the last candlestick

The high and low of the pattern

Illustration of a Bullish Engulfing pattern blending into a hammer, and a Bearish Engulfing pattern blending into a shooting star.
A Bullish Engulfing pattern blends into a hammer, and a Bearish Engulfing pattern blends into a shooting star.
By using the open of the first candlestick, close of the second candlestick, and high/low of the pattern, a Bullish Engulfing Pattern or Piercing Pattern blends into a Hammer. The long lower shadow of the Hammer signals a potential bullish reversal. As with the Hammer, the Bullish Engulfing Pattern and Piercing Pattern require bullish confirmation.

Illustration of a Piercing Pattern blending into a Hammer and a Dark Cloud Cover blending into a Shooting Star.
Blending a Piercing Pattern results in a Hammer, and a Blending Dark Cloud Cover results in a Shooting Star.
Blending the candlesticks of a Bearish Engulfing Pattern or Dark Cloud Cover Pattern creates a Shooting Star. The long, upper shadow of the Shooting Star indicates a potential bearish reversal. As with the Shooting Star, Bearish Engulfing, and Dark Cloud Cover Patterns require bearish confirmation.

Blending Three White Soldiers results in a long white candlestick and blending Three Black Crows results in a long black candlestick.
More than two candlesticks can be blended using the same guidelines: open from the first, close from the last, and high/low of the pattern. Blending Three White Soldiers creates a long white candlestick and blending Three Black Crows creates a long black candlestick.
